PRIORITY 
---

REFACTOR ALL THIS, RMEOVE TYPES create fields that have a getHtml() function similar to those in the Table Cells.
KISS: This Form object is WAY over complicated. SIMPLIFY IT BIGTIME. use callables and helpers for extending the 
form functionality.


TODO:
-----

 - [ ] IMPORTANT: Create usage documentation
 - [ ] Make unit test classes
 - [ ] Look at creating a Html Renderer that works without the Dom\Template lib ????
 - [ ] Create a renderer for Tabbed forms using javascript, this should be a universal solution ???
 - [ ] Add fieldsets to the form renderer (Not 100% sure how we will do this nicely)
 - [ ] Add all DOM renderer for the most basic and complete fields
